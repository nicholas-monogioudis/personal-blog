## Welcome to My Blog!

Hello, my name is **Nicholas Monogioudis**, a recent neuroscience graduate passionate about **clinical research, biotech, and AI in neuroscience**.  

### **Unlocking the Brain's Secrets**
This blog is where I share my insights on **neuroscience, research breakthroughs, and industry trends**, with a special focus on **cognitive neuroscience, neuropharmacology, and neurotechnology**.  

I aim to bridge the gap between complex neuroscience concepts and real-world applications, making cutting-edge research more accessible. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply someone curious about the brain, you'll find content here on:  

**The latest discoveries in neuroscience** and what they mean for the future  
**Deep dives into cognitive processes, brain function, and neural networks**  
**How neuroscience is shaping the pharmaceutical and biotech industries**  
**The intersection of neuroscience with AI, brain-computer interfaces, and neurotech**  
**Personal reflections on my journey in neuroscience and industry insights**  

### **My Background**

**Education:** B.Sc. in Neuroscience from Temple University  

**Research Experience:**  

  **Research Assistant, Concepts and Cognition Lab**
  
  1. Worked on an R01 grant focusing on detection of mild cognitive decline in minority populations
  2. Learned how to operate an SRI Eyelink 1000 Eye Tracker and a Wearable Sensing DSI 24 Channel EEG system
  3. Assisted in the creation of experiments utilizing the accompanying software and contributed to general pipeline development, including file organization pathways and refinement of procedures
 
    
  **Research Assistant, Aphasia Rehabilitation Research Lab**

  1. Tasked with all levels of participant testing and data collection for an R01 grant focusing on the development of a battery for aphasia in post-stroke populations
  2. Primary tasks included recruitment, administrating computerized tasks to participants, and entering/organizing data in REDCap software
  3. Further assisted in stimuli development and preparing data for analysis via auditing and cleaning


### **Career Goals:**  
  Ultimately, my career goal is to become a neuroscientist in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry, conducting research and development on new drugs or treatments for neurological conditions with a focus on drug discovery, clinical trials, and regulatory affairs.
