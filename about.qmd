## Welcome to My Blog!

Hello, my name is **Nicholas Monogioudis**, a recent neuroscience graduate passionate about **clinical research, biotech, and AI in neuroscience**.  

### **Unlocking the Brain's Secrets**
This blog is where I share my insights on **neuroscience, research breakthroughs, and industry trends**, with a special focus on **cognitive neuroscience, neuropharmacology, and neurotechnology**.  

I aim to bridge the gap between complex neuroscience concepts and real-world applications, making cutting-edge research more accessible. Whether you're a student, researcher, or simply someone curious about the brain, you'll find content here on:  

**The latest discoveries in neuroscience** and what they mean for the future  
**Deep dives into cognitive processes, brain function, and neural networks**  
**How neuroscience is shaping the pharmaceutical and biotech industries**  
**The intersection of neuroscience with AI, brain-computer interfaces, and neurotech**  
**Personal reflections on my journey in neuroscience and industry insights**  

### **My Background**

**Education:** B.Sc. in Neuroscience from Temple University  

**Research Experience:**  

  **Research Assistant, Concepts and Cognition Lab**  
    Conducted research on language, semantic memory, and progressive language impairment in dementia. Co-led eye-tracking research, administering tests and analyzing patient data. Gained experience with eye-tracking technology, EEG, and developing support guides for individuals with dementia and traumatic brain injury. 
    
  **Research Assistant, Aphasia Rehabilitation Lab**  
    Studied the cognitive relationship between verbal short-term memory and word processing disorders. Administered language assessments (Stroop Test, Boston Naming Test) and managed research data. Assisted in database organization for prior studies. 

### **Career Goals:**  
  Ultimately, my career goal is to become a neuroscientist in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industry, conducting research and development on new drugs or treatments for neurological conditions with a focus on drug discovery, clinical trials, and regulatory affairs.
