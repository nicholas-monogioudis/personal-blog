## PERIPHERAL INFLAMMATION AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO ALZHEIMER’S

Peripheral inflammation plays a large complex role in kickstarting and speeding the progression of Alzheimer’s disease. It’s driven by several factors that ramp up body-wide inflammation and set off inflammatory responses in the brain. One major player in this process is the gut-brain axis, which Cryan and colleagues explored. They showed that gut bacteria have a real impact on brain inflammation. Emerging evidence suggests that gut microbiota imbalances, or dysbiosis, contribute to systemic inflammation, which can exacerbate neuroinflammation in Alzheimer’s disease. Dysbiosis has been shown to elevate inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and pro-inflammatory cytokines in the bloodstream [@Cryan2019TheGM]. These markers may cross the blood-brain barrier, triggering inflammatory responses in the central nervous system [@Fung2017InteractionsBT]. In the context of AD, such inflammation promotes the aggregation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles, accelerating disease progression [@Cattaneo2017AssociationOB][@Harach2017ReductionOA]. These findings underscore the potential role of the gut-brain axis in modulating neuroinflammation and highlight the need for therapeutic strategies targeting gut health to mitigate AD progression. Cryan et al. also point out a connection between metabolic problems, like obesity, insulin resistance, and brain inflammation. They propose that inflammation triggered by these metabolic problems might contribute to AD. Of these, insulin resistance plays a big role in Alzheimer’s development since it can harm brain function and encourage the buildup of amyloid plaques.

[@Craft2005InsulinRS] highlights how systemic diseases, especially heart problems and diabetes, contribute to brain inflammation and cognitive decline. Conditions like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and type 2 diabetes raise the chances of developing Alzheimer's by increasing peripheral inflammation throughout the body. These diseases boost the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can make their way to the brain and activate glial cells. This kind of chronic inflammation is a major risk factor for cognitive decline and brain cell damage, and having these conditions over time speeds up the development of Alzheimer's.

Besides metabolic and cardiovascular factors, chronic stress also plays a big role in inflammation and its link to Alzheimer's disease. According to [@McEwen2012BrainOS], stress hormones, especially cortisol, can harm the brain by triggering the production of inflammatory molecules. Long-term exposure to high cortisol levels has been linked to a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia, as it also activates microglia. On top of that, stress-related inflammation can make other Alzheimer’s risk factors, like high blood pressure worse, creating a cycle that speeds up cognitive decline. McEwen’s research shows how our social environment, particularly chronic stress, can play a key role in the development of AD.
