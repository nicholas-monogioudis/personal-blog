## INTRODUCTION

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder
that leads to memory loss, confusion, and a gradual decline in both
cognitive and physical abilities (Alzheimer's Association, 2023). As
global life expectancy continues to rise, the prevalence of AD is also
increasing, which places a lot pressure on patients, their families, and
healthcare systems around the world [@Prince2015WorldAR]. Today, AD
ranks among the leading causes of dementia and disability in older
adults, which causes serious challenges not only to patients but also to
caregivers and society as a whole (World Health Organization, 2022).

For decades, the predominant explanation for Alzheimer's has been the
"amyloid hypothesis," which credits the disease to the accumulation of
amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain [@Hardy2009TheAH]. These abnormal protein build-ups disrupt neuronal communication,
trigger cell death, and have been central to most research and
therapeutic strategies (Selkoe & Hardy, 2016). Genetic factors, such as
the APOE4 gene, have also been linked to increased risk and progression
of AD [@Liu2013ApolipoproteinEA]. While the amyloid hypothesis has guided much
of the scientific investigation, treatments targeting amyloid plaques
have mostly fallen short in giving significant clinical benefits [@Cummings2019TreatmentCF]. This has led researchers to explore alternative
mechanisms that may contribute to the onset and progression of
Alzheimer's.

Emerging evidence points to chronic inflammation as a critical driver of
AD pathology. Unlike acute inflammation, which is a short-term and
protective immune response, chronic inflammation is a prolonged state
that disrupts normal physiological function [@Heppner2015ImmuneAT]. In
the brain, this persistent inflammation can arise from factors such as
metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and unhealthy lifestyle habits [@Heneka2015NeuroinflammationIA]. Over time, these triggers activate immune cells
like microglia and astrocytes, which, instead of protecting neurons,
begin to release inflammatory molecules that damage healthy brain cells [@Glass2010MechanismsUI]. This inflammatory environment not only accelerates
the formation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles but also impairs
synaptic communication and neuronal survival [@WyssCoray2012InflammationIA].

This paper argues that chronic inflammation is not merely a byproduct of
Alzheimer's disease but a fundamental contributor to its development and
progression. Specifically, this paper proposes that metabolic and immune
dysregulation underlie the chronic inflammatory state observed in AD.
Understanding how inflammation interacts with other pathological
processes, such as amyloid and tau aggregation, may provide crucial
insights into the disease's mechanisms. By targeting the root causes of
neuroinflammation---whether through lifestyle interventions,
anti-inflammatory treatments, or metabolic regulation---we may open new
avenues for slowing or even preventing the progression of Alzheimer's
disease [@Heneka2018InflammasomeSI].

This hypothesis is supported by recent studies that link inflammation
markers to cognitive decline (Walker et al., 2019) and displays the
presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brains of Alzheimer's
patients [@SurezCalvet2016sTREM2CF]. Additionally, experimental models
have shown that reducing inflammation can better neuronal damage and
improve cognitive function (Yin et al., 2021). These findings highlight
the need to shift our focus beyond amyloid-centric approaches and
towards addressing the multifaceted role of inflammation in AD. By doing
so, we can move closer to developing more effective therapeutic
strategies for this devastating disease.
