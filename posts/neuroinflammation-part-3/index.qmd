## GENETIC RISK FACTORS AND INFLAMMATORY PATHWAYS

Genetic factors play a crucial role in determining the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with differences in certain genes significantly influencing the brain's inflammatory responses. Among these, changes in the TREM2 gene and the APOE4 allele are particularly noteworthy for their contributions to the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. These genetic factors are linked not only to an increased susceptibility to AD but also to the modulation of neuroinflammation, a hallmark of the disease.

One of the most studied genes in relation to Alzheimer's risk is TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2). TREM2 is involved in the functioning of microglia. Variations in the TREM2 gene, particularly rare mutations, have been shown to impair the ability of microglia to respond effectively to neurodegenerative signals. As a result, this increases neuroinflammation and accelerates the progression of AD.[@Guerreiro2013TREM2VI] demonstrated that mutations in the TREM2 gene lead to a big reduction in the ability of microglia to efficiently manage amyloid-beta plaques and other neurotoxic agents. This impairment not only results in the accumulation of amyloid plaques but also contributes to a chronic inflammatory environment that exacerbates neuronal damage. The disruption of microglial clearance and the subsequent rise in inflammatory cytokines fuels the neurodegenerative process, creating a cycle that accelerates cognitive decline.

In addition to TREM2 mutations, the APOE4 allele is another major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. APOE4, a variant of the apolipoprotein E gene, has been well established as a genetic variant that increases the risk of Alzheimer’s and is particularly associated with an earlier onset of the disease. The presence of the APOE4 allele has been shown to enhance inflammation in the brain by promoting the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, including cytokines and chemokines. According to [@Mahley2012ApolipoproteinES], APOE4 not only increases the production of these inflammatory molecules but also impairs the ability of microglia to clear amyloid-beta plaques, leading to a further accumulation of plaques and greater neuronal damage. In particular, APOE4 has been shown to alter the response of microglia, making them less effective at resolving inflammation and promoting tissue repair, thus worsening the neurodegenerative process [@Li2015LinkBT].

Together, these genetic factors highlight the central role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease. Both TREM2 mutations and the APOE4 allele emphasize how genetic variations can influence the brain’s inflammatory pathways and contribute to the disease. The findings suggest that addressing neuroinflammation, potentially through the influence of microglial activity or the inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, could be a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer’s disease. These insights have opened new avenues for research aimed at understanding the intricate relationship between genetics, inflammation, and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's. Further studies on the interaction between genetic risk factors and inflammatory processes are essential for developing targeted interventions that may help mitigate the devastating effects of Alzheimer’s disease.
