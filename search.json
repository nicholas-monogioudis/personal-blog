    "text": "GENETIC RISK FACTORS AND INFLAMMATORY PATHWAYS\nGenetic factors play a crucial role in determining the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with differences in certain genes significantly influencing the brain’s inflammatory responses. Among these, changes in the TREM2 gene and the APOE4 allele are particularly noteworthy for their contributions to the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. These genetic factors are linked not only to an increased susceptibility to AD but also to the modulation of neuroinflammation, a hallmark of the disease.\nOne of the most studied genes in relation to Alzheimer’s risk is TREM2 (Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2). TREM2 is involved in the functioning of microglia. Variations in the TREM2 gene, particularly rare mutations, have been shown to impair the ability of microglia to respond effectively to neurodegenerative signals. As a result, this increases neuroinflammation and accelerates the progression of AD.(Guerreiro et al. 2013) demonstrated that mutations in the TREM2 gene lead to a big reduction in the ability of microglia to efficiently manage amyloid-beta plaques and other neurotoxic agents. This impairment not only results in the accumulation of amyloid plaques but also contributes to a chronic inflammatory environment that exacerbates neuronal damage. The disruption of microglial clearance and the subsequent rise in inflammatory cytokines fuels the neurodegenerative process, creating a cycle that accelerates cognitive decline.\nIn addition to TREM2 mutations, the APOE4 allele is another major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease. APOE4, a variant of the apolipoprotein E gene, has been well established as a genetic variant that increases the risk of Alzheimer’s and is particularly associated with an earlier onset of the disease. The presence of the APOE4 allele has been shown to enhance inflammation in the brain by promoting the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, including cytokines and chemokines. According to (Mahley and Huang 2012), APOE4 not only increases the production of these inflammatory molecules but also impairs the ability of microglia to clear amyloid-beta plaques, leading to a further accumulation of plaques and greater neuronal damage. In particular, APOE4 has been shown to alter the response of microglia, making them less effective at resolving inflammation and promoting tissue repair, thus worsening the neurodegenerative process (Li, Song, and Leng 2015).\nTogether, these genetic factors highlight the central role of immune dysfunction in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. Both TREM2 mutations and the APOE4 allele emphasize how genetic variations can influence the brain’s inflammatory pathways and contribute to the disease. The findings suggest that addressing neuroinflammation, potentially through the influence of microglial activity or the inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways, could be a promising therapeutic strategy for Alzheimer’s disease. These insights have opened new avenues for research aimed at understanding the intricate relationship between genetics, inflammation, and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer’s. Further studies on the interaction between genetic risk factors and inflammatory processes are essential for developing targeted interventions that may help mitigate the devastating effects of Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nReferences\n\n\nGuerreiro, Rita, Aleksandra M.

    "section": "INTRODUCTION",
    "text": "INTRODUCTION\nAlzheimer’s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that leads to memory loss, confusion, and a gradual decline in both cognitive and physical abilities (Alzheimer’s Association, 2023). As global life expectancy continues to rise, the prevalence of AD is also increasing, which places a lot pressure on patients, their families, and healthcare systems around the world (Prince et al. 2015). Today, AD ranks among the leading causes of dementia and disability in older adults, which causes serious challenges not only to patients but also to caregivers and society as a whole (World Health Organization, 2022).\nFor decades, the predominant explanation for Alzheimer’s has been the “amyloid hypothesis,” which credits the disease to the accumulation of amyloid-beta plaques and tau tangles in the brain (Hardy and Selkoe 2009). These abnormal protein build-ups disrupt neuronal communication, trigger cell death, and have been central to most research and therapeutic strategies (Selkoe & Hardy, 2016). Genetic factors, such as the APOE4 gene, have also been linked to increased risk and progression of AD (Liu et al. 2013). While the amyloid hypothesis has guided much of the scientific investigation, treatments targeting amyloid plaques have mostly fallen short in giving significant clinical benefits (Cummings, Tong, and Ballard 2019). This has led researchers to explore alternative mechanisms that may contribute to the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s.\nEmerging evidence points to chronic inflammation as a critical driver of AD pathology. Unlike acute inflammation, which is a short-term and protective immune response, chronic inflammation is a prolonged state that disrupts normal physiological function (Heppner, Ransohoff, and Becher 2015). In the brain, this persistent inflammation can arise from factors such as metabolic dysfunction, oxidative stress, and unhealthy lifestyle habits (Heneka et al. 2015). Over time, these triggers activate immune cells like microglia and astrocytes, which, instead of protecting neurons, begin to release inflammatory molecules that damage healthy brain cells (Glass et al. 2010). This inflammatory environment not only accelerates the formation of amyloid plaques and tau tangles but also impairs synaptic communication and neuronal survival (Wyss-Coray and Rogers 2012).\nThis paper argues that chronic inflammation is not merely a byproduct of Alzheimer’s disease but a fundamental contributor to its development and progression. Specifically, this paper proposes that metabolic and immune dysregulation underlie the chronic inflammatory state observed in AD. Understanding how inflammation interacts with other pathological processes, such as amyloid and tau aggregation, may provide crucial insights into the disease’s mechanisms. By targeting the root causes of neuroinflammation—whether through lifestyle interventions, anti-inflammatory treatments, or metabolic regulation—we may open new avenues for slowing or even preventing the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (Heneka, McManus, and Latz 2018).\nThis hypothesis is supported by recent studies that link inflammation markers to cognitive decline (Walker et al., 2019) and displays the presence of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients (Suárez-Calvet et al. 2016). Additionally, experimental models have shown that reducing inflammation can better neuronal damage and improve cognitive function (Yin et al., 2021). These findings highlight the need to shift our focus beyond amyloid-centric approaches and towards addressing the multifaceted role of inflammation in AD. By doing so, we can move closer to developing more effective therapeutic strategies for this devastating disease.\n\nReferences\n\n\nCummings, Jeffrey L., Gary Tong, and Clive G Ballard. 2019. “Treatment Combinations for Alzheimer’s Disease: Current and Future Pharmacotherapy Options.” Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease 67: 779–94. https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:59339279.\n\n\nGlass, Christopher K., Kaoru Saijo, Beate Winner, Maria Carolina Marchetto, and Fred H.

    "section": "THE ROLE OF NEUROINFLAMMATION IN ALZHEIMER’S PATHOLOGY",
    "text": "THE ROLE OF NEUROINFLAMMATION IN ALZHEIMER’S PATHOLOGY\nNeuroinflammation is now recognized as a major contributor to Alzheimer’s disease. A key part of this is the role of microglia which are immune cells in the brain that keep things balanced by responding to injuries, infections, and other disruptions. In Alzheimer’s disease, microglia (the brain’s resident immune cells) are constantly activated. This is different from their normal transient activation during acute immune responses (Heneka et al., 2015). This chronic activation causes a cascade of damaging effects, including the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-1β and TNF-α, as well as reactive oxygen species, which lead to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal death [Glass et al. (2010)](Suárez-Calvet et al. 2016). As microglia continuously attack neurons, they contribute to the disruption of synaptic connections and increase cognitive decline and memory impairments characteristic of Alzheimer’s disease (Wyss-Coray and Rogers 2012). This suggests that microglial dysregulation is a central mechanism driving neurodegeneration in AD, perpetuating the cycle of inflammation and neuronal loss. This highlights how immune dysregulation contributes not just to neuronal loss but also to the overall progression of AD.\nAs stated above, cytokines have a prominent role in Alzheimer’s disease. Key molecules like interleukin-1β (IL-1β), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) all have higher levels in the brains of people with AD. As a result, synaptic function and plasticity are affected. The increase in cytokine levels not only helps trigger the hyperphosphorylation of tau (a major hallmark of AD) which weakens neurons even more (Wyss-Coray and Rogers 2012), they also make it easier for amyloid plaques to form. This creates a cycle of inflammation and neuronal damage.\nIn addition to the direct effects of cytokines, a key part of AD is the back-and-forth between amyloid-beta build-up and brain inflammation. When amyloid-beta plaques pile up in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s, they signal to fire inflammatory molecules from microglia, which then speed up the deposits of even more amyloid-beta. This cycle of plaques causing inflammation, and inflammation causing more plaques, really drives the progression of the disease. Studies suggest that breaking this loop could help lower plaque build-up and slow down the disease, making neuroinflammation an exciting target for new treatments (Heppner, Ransohoff, and Becher 2015). Since the link between amyloid-beta and inflammation is very complicated, targeting the inflammation might help stop this. Ths gives hope for future therapies that could delay or even prevent Alzheimer’s. Thus, getting a better handle on inflammation is essential for finding more effective treatments.\n\nReferences\n\n\nGlass, Christopher K., Kaoru Saijo, Beate Winner, Maria Carolina Marchetto, and Fred H.
